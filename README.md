# NumPy 18 - Python Script for Data Manipulation and Analysis

## Overview

This Python script, `numpy18.py`, demonstrates the use of the NumPy library for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis. NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## Features

The `numpy18.py` script includes the following key functionalities:

- **Array Creation and Manipulation**: 
  - Creating and initializing NumPy arrays.
  - Performing basic array operations like addition, multiplication, and broadcasting.
  - Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays.

- **Data Aggregation**:
  - Calculating summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and sum.
  - Grouping and aggregating data.

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Identifying outliers in datasets.
  - Calculating percentiles and correlations.
  - Demonstrating the efficiency of NumPy in handling large datasets.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have Python installed along with the NumPy library. You can install NumPy using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
